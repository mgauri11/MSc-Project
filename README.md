This project was developed as a part of my dissertation - Assessment Feedback Booking System. The src folder contains files for frontend and the files outside of src folder are backend files. For privacy reasons the clientID is hidden(generated after an application is registered with Microsoft Azure AD). I'm currently facing some issues with pushing the entire backend folder from VS code editor(I'll fix it in comng days!) that is the reason all the backend files are without folder. Also, the project was in private repo until now because I received 72%(distinction) for the project.

Tech stack used for the system: MERN stack- ReactJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, NodeJs, UI toolkit: React Bootstrap & Blueprint, React Testing framework: Jest, API endpoint testing: Postman (for testing backend endpoints) Microsoft Graph Explorer (for testing Calendar API methods), Methodology: Agile/iterative, Version control: GitHub.
